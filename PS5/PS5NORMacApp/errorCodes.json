                  "solution": "1) Check PSN status if there is any server failure or maintenance. 2) Reboot the console, connect via a wired connection and reconfigure the connection settings. 3) When using a wireless connection, move the console closer to the router or remove anything interrupting the connection between the devices. 4) Power cycle the modem/router. 5) Update router firmware. 6) If possible, try opening these ports: TCP: 80, 443, 3478, 3479, 3480 and UDP: 3478, 3479, 49152～65535. 7) Try setting up a static IP address manually to improve the connection. 8) Try temporarily changing the DNS address to a public DNS (e.g. Google). If none of these work, then the line is likely to be temporarily busy. Leave it for a while and try again later."

                  "solution": "1) Check the PSN status page to see whether there's a server failure or maintenance going on. 2) Reboot the console, and connect to the internet using a wired (ethernet) connection if possible and reconfigure the connection settings. 3) When using Wi-Fi, make sure the console is as close as possible to the router. Otherwise, remove any items that could be blocking or interfering with the connection. 4) Power cycle the router/modem. 5) Update router firmware (contact ISP or network administrator). 6) If possible, speak to your ISP about how to cancel the port filtering function on the router. 7) Try manually setting up a static IP address by going to [Settings] > [Network] > [Settings] > [Set Up Internet Connection]. If still having issues, try again later."
